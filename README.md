# *Chimera Faceoff*

## General Idea
Game is a pokemon-esque style. Pit two chimeras against each other and fight until one peacefully falls asleep. These Chimeras possess a fighting-strength that will increase or decrease based on their attributes, and whether or not they got attributes that aligned well to an environment(i.e flippers would give a low fighting strength, but if the island subtype was chosen it would rather give a much higher strength due to the presence of water). This fighting strength attribute would apply multipliers to pre existing values of AttackPower,Defense,Mobility,Etc. For example, Flippers would have a relatively low mobility chance UNLESS they were in water, at that point they would have a multiplier applied to increase that chance(+3.00x mobility for example). In contrast, something like wings may get a debuff if they fall into water or get wet(-2.00x) .  

You can only assign one attribute per part, and will cycle through them (Eyes
Attributes will have a point-style system as they are chosen. There will be positive attributes and negative attributes. The player will have a point-pool to begin with (i.e 10 points), and each positive attribute( bonus-granting) will decrease that pool, and each negative attribute will give points to that pool.

Animals will have unique attributes such as eyesight(night-vision, movement-based etc.) These values will determine how well a chimera , skin (scales, fur, etc for protection values). Certain attributes can be applied multiple times to different parts of the body (head,arms,torso,legs,tail if it applies). 

There will be random-aspects such as weather, and environment type. This randomness is to challenge the player, with certain ‘parts’ being more advantageous in certain environments or situations, but then sacrificing that advantage in others. This is to encourage the player not to make an entirely tanky, large character that would win every time because it is not too adaptable and would lose in the wrong type of environment. The challenge is to try to make an adaptable creature that would fare well in all types of environments, whilst being under the restriction of a point pool.




## Attributes



## Environment
The environment will be completely randomized, and  to make the player(s) have to configure an animal to better suit their environment each playthrough.(They will not know what the environment is, its up to the player to either build their chimera towards adaptability or to build their animal to suit one particular environment.

List of  MAIN TYPES OF environments(; Plains, Mountains, beach, ) These will be deterministic factors of which subtype is chosen. These main types are more so categories from which a specific environment will be chosen(i.e If you get a beach environment, go the the subtype list and choose a random one. Let’s say you get an island.)

List of SUB types of environments( Sub meaning they fall under a broader category of environments) ; 
### Mountain subtypes
* Ravine(Wing types apply a buff)
* Peak of mountain(Cold, fur gets a slight buff scaly skin gets debuff)
* Cliffside(Hoofed feet buff)
* Volcano(scale skin buff
### Plains Subtypes: 
* Forest (Obscures vision slightly, favors flying chimeras, smaller chimeras(Stealth?))
* Cave(Dark vision applies a buff, hearing applies a buff) 
* Jungle[may be implemented,unsure](Optional, buffs climbing/clawed or sticky hands/stealth)
* Hills(Mass affects ability to walk unimpeded)
* Small lake/river (Buffs swimming chimera’s mobility)

### Beach subtypes
* Rocky beach(Hurts certain feet affecting mobility/dodge), 
* Desert(Hot, affects energy OR hurts feet)
* Island(Reduced mobility //dodge for chimeras a little bit, unless semi aquatic[Webbed feet?], then keep the same mobility #.)

## Weather/Time(Randomized)


* Rain(Reduces mobility multiplier of furred organisms, increases mobility multiplier of slimy-skinned animals) 
* Lightning storm(Chimera’s with big ears like elephants, bats, might be disorientated for a couple of seconds or reduced hearing in general, 
* Sunny, Night Time, 
* Winter/snowing, 
* Hailing,
 Summer(Not really a weather.., cold)

### Rarer weather(Option to be ticked on or off as these would make the game’s winner almost impossible to determine through configuring), Tornado, Earthquake, Tsunami, Avalanche/Rock slide((Mountain exclusive), eruption(Volcano exclusive) , ?
